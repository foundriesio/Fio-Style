  #nonword: true
level: warning
tokens:
# Note, while some instances, such as spaces around a hypen, will trigger a warning errounously,
# the assumption is that in most of these tokens, an em dash is generally what is desired.
# This is why the rule is set to a warning rather than an error. 
  - '\b[-–—]\s'
  - '\s[-–—]\b'
# excluding en dash, as this may occur when the presence of an en dash is correct
  - '\s[-–]\s'
